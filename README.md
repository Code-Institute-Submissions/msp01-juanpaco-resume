# Juan Paco Resume

This is my first **Code Institute** milestone product about *User-Centric Frontend Development*.

In this web page I want to show you my professional experience as a _Logistics Specialist_ before I started studying for _Full Stack Web Developer_ at Code Institute. Both specialties can complement them each other to offer a better value proposition to future products developments.
 
## UX

### User stories
- "As a business partner, specialist or client, I expect to learn about Juan Francisco's projects and problem solving strategy as a solutions engineer. In the left section of the navigation bar I can find out what services he offers me and how he does it."

- "As a recruiter, I expect to discover that Juan Francisco have the requirements to be considered as a candidate to occupy a position as a solutions engineer in the areas of logistics or software development. For this the options in the upper right part of the navigation bar I can know his resume."

- Also, at the footer navigation bar you have the access to my social networks and a PDF version of my resume.

## Features
 
For the construction of this site the following features were used:
### Existing Features
- Modals to display the contact window anywhere on the site.
- Media Queries to adjust site characteristics to different device sizes.
- Scrollspy to identify the section of the page where you are browsing at the `index.html`
- Navs, Tables, Jumbotron, and Grid features. 
- The external links open in a new tab. 


### Features Left to Implement
The following features will be added to the site soon:
- Adding feature to send email.
- Adding education and skills content with progress bars.
- Various types of content animation. For example brief movement of the images when they appear for the first time.
- Links to keywords will be added to drill-down into concepts mentioned in the text. For example: operating models, route to market, cost-to-serve, etc.
- In the stories section, the table will be adjusted to a fixed size within the screen.
- Hide and show footer and nav automatically.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS - media queries, ovewwrite definitions, etc.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - scrollspy, modal, nav, col-rows, etc

## Testing

The project was tested to work in **Chrome/Safari** browser of desktops, tablets and phones. Its functionality was tested using the Chrome inspect function for different devices.

In any case, the situations that need to be corrected are:

- When reaching the end of the pages, the visibility of 80px row is lost by the fixed footer.
- I'm working on the missing images in the discover - design - collaborate sections. 

## Deployment

The website is published using GitHub Pages and you can visited by clicling the following link: https://pacotools.github.io/msp01-juanpaco-resume/

This project was developed using **GitHub** and **GitPod**. I use the **Code Institute** template.

Both the development and deployment versions and their resources reside on the GitHub platform for educational use. The repository name is `msp01-juanpaco-resume`
