# Juan Paco Resume

This is my first **Code Institute** milestone product about *User-Centric Frontend Development*.

In this web page I want to show you my professional experience as a _Logistics Specialist_ before I started studying for _Full Stack Web Developer_ at Code Institute. Both specialties can complement them each other to offer a better value proposition to future products developments.
 
## UX

### User stories
- As a business partner, specialist or client, my expectation is to learn about Juan Francisco's projects and problem solving strategy as a solutions engineer. In the left section of the navigation bar I can find out what services he offers me and how he does it.

- As a recruiter, my expectation is to discover that Juan Francisco has all the requirements to be considered as a candidate to occupy a position as a solutions engineer in the areas of logistics or software development. For this the options in the upper right part of the navigation bar I can know his resume.

- In the lower navigation bar is the access to my social networks and a PDF version of my resume.

## Features
 
### Existing Features

- Stories.  In the "stories" option, recruiters and specialists can review the description of some implemented projects. In the phone version only the name of the project can be seen.
- Contact. By clicking on contact, a modal window is displayed so that specialists and clients can establish contact for any future project. The option is not yet enabled to send emails.

- The web page has a _bar menu_ divided in right and left options. The options at your left you can know about "What I Do?" and "How I Do It?". In particular, if you are at consumer goods business, my value proposition is that I can help you to discover insights, design disruptive products and collaborate with your team to succeed.
