# Juan Paco Resume

This is my first Code Institute milestone product about User-Centric Frontend.

In this web page I want to show you my professional experience as a _Logistics Specialist_ before I started studying for _Full Stack Web Developer_ at Code Institute. Both specialties can complement them each other to offer a better value proposition to future products developments.
 
## UX

- The web page has a _bar menu_ divided in right and left options. The options at your left you can know about "What I Do?" and "How I Do It?". In particular, if you are at consumer goods business, my value proposition is that I can help you to discover insights, design disruptive products and collaborate with your team to succeed. 

- The options at your right are about my education and experience in order to respond to question about "Why Hire Me?". Through the resume option I share my professional and educational career and in the stories section are the descriptions and results of some relevant projects.

- Similarly, _the footer_ is divided into two parts. Options at your left are about social networking as LinkedIn and Twitter. At right, the external links are about future educational clips (YouTube) and real coding (GitHub). 

- At center of header, always the home option is my photo. And at center of footer you can download my pdf CV.
